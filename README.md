RockPaperScissors.
This is a game usually played between two people(user and computer).
The user and the computer will choose one among 1.Rock 2.Paper 3.Scissors.
It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss.
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"),
but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The type of game originated in China and spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs over time.
